# Django Project Readme

Welcome to your new Django project! This README file will guide you through setting up your development environment, creating a new Django project, and getting started with your project.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install Python:**

   Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   Virtual environments allow you to isolate project dependencies. Install virtualenv via pip:
   
   ```bash
   pip install virtualenv
   ```

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

   ```bash
   mkdir myproject
   cd myproject
   ```

   Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m virtualenv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Django:**

   Install Django using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install django
   ```

## Creating a New Django Project

1. **Start a New Django Project:**

   Create a new Django project using the `django-admin` command:

   ```bash
   django-admin startproject config .
   ```

   Replace `config` with your desired project name.

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd myproject
   ```

## Running Your Django Project

1. **Run the Development Server:**

   Navigate into your project directory if you're not already there, and run the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   Your Django project should now be running locally! Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to see the Django welcome page.

2. **Create a Superuser:**

   To access the Django admin interface, create a superuser:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

   Follow the prompts to create your superuser account.
